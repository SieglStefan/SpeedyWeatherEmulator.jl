# Examples

This section provides the code used to produce the results presented in the project report, along with additional examples and outputs. The plotting routines themselves are omitted here, but interested readers can find the corresponding code under [examples](https://github.com/SieglStefan/SpeedyWeatherEmulator.jl/tree/main/utils/examples) in the repository.


The [Project Report](https://github.com/SieglStefan/SpeedyWeatherEmulator.jl/blob/main/ProjectReport.pdf) provides a quick overview of the examples without code snippets. Furthermore, it briefly introduces the necessity and background of  emulators and explains and discusses the results.
